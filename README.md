// Create a class for players charecter

	// Give it different instances
			// Health 
			// Damage  
	// Give it different methods 

			// for defending 
				
				// if the player is being attacked they can defend with shield 
				
				// if sheild hits enemys weapons 
					
					// then players sheild will deflect the weapons back towards the enemy 
						// the players defense will only have a 75% chance of hitting the enemy
										// Math.random
			// player can run back and fourth using arrows to dodge the enemy 
		
		// CREATE A DEAD FUNCTION
				// check players health if hit CHECK ALIVE
		  
		  // if players health is = 0 player is dead 
		  // alert user "You is failure. You is dead."


// instantiate player


// pull both these together into one class // 

// Create a class for the Enemy charector 

	// Give it different instances 
			// Health 
			// Damage 
			// Speed 

		// The enemy will constantly be shooting 

				// if the enemy hits the player 
					// the enemy has a 75% chance of reducing the players health 

				// Every x minutes the enemys shotting speed will increse across the screen

			// CREATE A DIE FUNCTION
				// check enemys health if hit CHECK ALIVE

			// if enemys health is = 0 enemy is dead and falls from screen
			// alert user "FATALITY" 

// instantiate enemy 


 // ONCE THIS WORKS DO THIS //



// Have a front page that displays a background photo
	
	// Has two buttons "Instructions" - instructions are displayed when clickked

// When player either wins or dies pop up whichever alert and a button to "start over"

	// Have a health bar for both player and enemy charectors linked to their classes
